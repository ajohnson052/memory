As a player, I should be able to load a board with randomized squares so I can have a new game to play.

As a player, all of the squares should appear the same when I initially load the game so I do not know the contents of each square.

As a player, I should be able to click on squares to reveal what they are so I can see the contents of a square.

As a player I should not be able to reveal more than two squares at a time so I must remember the contents of each square.

As a player, I should be able to clear two squares by clicking on two matching squares in a row so I can make progress in the game.
