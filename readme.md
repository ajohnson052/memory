As a player, I should be able to load a board with randomized squares so I can have a new game to play.

As a player, all of the squares should appear the same when I initially load the game so I do not know the contents of each square.

As a player, I should be able to click on squares to reveal what they are so I can see the contents of a square.

As a player I should not be able to reveal more than two squares at a time so I must remember the contents of each square.

As a player, I should be able to clear two squares by clicking on two matching squares in a row so I can make progress in the game.

To my knowledge most of the bugs have been worked out in the current version. One that is left is that the "try again" scrolling across appears to briefly jump to one line lower sometimes. mdn, jquery documentation, and friends were helpful in solving the issues that came up. I also found that it was useful to have other people play the game because they would click in patterns that I hadn't anticipated.

I might like to add some features including a reveal of cards button, and more animation on winning.
