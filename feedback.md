### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)? __1 Meets expectations__

  * A **hosted copy of your game or app, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages

    :+1:

  * Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    _CSS validates but the html validator returns errors with legal attributes on buttons and a rogue script closing tag after a link tag in the header_

  * A **git repository hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project

    :+1:


  * A **link to your hosted project** in the URL section of your Github repo

    _Please be sure to add this_



  * **A ``readme.md`` file**, including
    * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

      _Be sure to include technologies used, this project would have just been HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Github. This is really useful when job searching so you can quickly find projects where you used particular technologies_

    * At least 5 [user stories](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/02-intermediate-front-end/process-stories-wireframes).

      :+1:_Great job on the user strories_


* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex? __1 Meets expectations__

  Your app must:

  * **Render in the browser** :+1:
  * **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files** :+1:
  * Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles :+1:
  * Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** :+1:
  * **Deploy online**, using [Github **Project** pages](https://pages.github.com). :+1: (be sure to add that link to the repository)
  * Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices) :+1: (You should put that HTML through a validator and just get those couple things cleaned up)

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  _Really nice job. Code is clean and readable and you did a great job looking at functionality in a modular way. Functions perform individual tasks and call other functions before any one function gets to bulky._

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  _In the submission form you mentioned that you didn't know if the checking background color was the best way to look for a match. It might be better to instead give the tiles classes or "data- " attributes to keep track of which is which and then in the JavaScript use that colors array to set backgrounds and then just compare classes or "data- " attribute values to see if cards are equal. We really haven't talked about that so the way you've solved the problem works great and I'm really glad you noted that it didn't seem quite right_


* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between: __2 Exceeds expecations__ Great job! Take a few minutes when you have a chance to make sure that HTML is validating and adding the URL to the repository.


Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations_



This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
